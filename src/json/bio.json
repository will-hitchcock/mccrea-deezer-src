		"I appreciate you taking the time to check me out and hear my story. My trials and tribulations affect the way I view the lens. My experiences broaden my scope of the beautiful ugly. I realized that life will deal you a messed up hand and it's up to you to keep fighting with the good one tied behind your back. I'm a guy who has seen a lot and been through a lot. And through it all, by the grace of God I'm still here, trying to stay lit when the shade comes. My music is me capturing moments of life; a reflection of the energy I put out into the universe to create balance. Do I see myself stopping? #NoNo"
